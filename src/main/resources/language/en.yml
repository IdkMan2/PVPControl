# This is the translation file where you can define your own translations, prefixes and much much more.
# You can use in some places special variables like %command%, %usage% etc. but it works only for certian entries where variables list was defined in a comment above.
# Have on mind that if you want to do a "hard-enter" you need to use "\n" character and surround your text with double quotes.
# And of course you don't have to use all available variables - You don't have to use them at all if you wish.
